- Never invent or alter a title, URL, DOI, applicant, publisher, date, market

- Preserve the distinction between observed facts, estimates, and analyst
  inferences. State evidence gaps instead of filling them with prior knowledge.
- Treat search snippets as fragments and company disclosures as attributed
  first-party claims, not independent confirmation.
- Patent observations are preliminary landscape research, not legal advice or

    """Execute ``kickoff_fn`` within ``exec_time`` seconds with deterministic cleanup.

    Returns a tuple ``(result, worker_stopped)``.

    If execution exceeds ``exec_time``:
    1. Stage 1: Actively signals ``cancel_event`` (if provided) and invokes ``cancel_callback()``
       (if provided) to trigger cooperative resource/task cancellation.
    2. Stage 2: If the worker thread remains alive, asynchronously injects ``TimeoutError``
       into the worker thread's bytecode evaluation loop via ``PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc``
       to interrupt uncooperative loops or synchronous functions.
    3. Avoids context-managed ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` context blocks whose ``__exit__``
       blocks on unfinished worker threads.
    4. Joins the worker thread with a short bounded timeout (0.2s) and explicitly
       verifies worker shutdown (``worker_stopped = not worker.is_alive()``).
    5. Raises ``TimeoutError`` containing deadline and worker status diagnostics.

    Guarantees & Boundaries:
    - **Local Execution Termination & Resource Cleanup**: Guarantees bounded local
      wait time (elapsed time strictly upper-bounded: ``elapsed < deadline + margin``)
      and local task resource cleanup upon deadline expiration. The caller returns
      promptly, cell status is recorded as ``error_timeout``, and local worker state
      is verified.
    - **Remote Provider Cancellation & Token Consumption**: Once an upstream HTTP
      request has been dispatched to a remote LLM provider (e.g. OpenAI, DeepSeek,
      Anthropic, Ollama), server-side generation cancellation and billing/token
      consumption depend on the remote provider's API behavior (whether socket
      disconnects or cancellation signals are honored by the remote endpoint) and
      are not guaranteed by local execution termination alone.
